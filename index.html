To the remarkable collective that is the Winc Team,<br><br>

Where many focus on the destination, I feel our journey itself has been an extraordinary adventure worth celebrating. Despite the challenges we faced, the joy of learning triumphed, making this journey all the more significant, given that this was within the dynamic environment of a startup.<br><br>

To commemorate this beautiful journey, I've crafted this website as a token of appreciation and a fond remembrance of the lessons learned. My passion for computers found new momentum during my tenure here, and I credit this to the enriching experiences and knowledge I've gained during this time.<br><br>

Alison, your openness to feedback and readiness to address concerns has meant a lot to me. Knowing that you'd act on those concerns to make the journey smoother for future students is something I admire.<br><br>

Chris, your dedication and commitment to your students are truly inspiring. The fact that you offered to extend the class to resolve more queries even after the lesson ended will always resonate with me. As someone who has walked in a teacherâ€™s shoes, I admire your efforts to improve the live sessions.<br><br>

Mark, your guidance was a beacon of hope during my challenging times, especially while working on the React Final project. Your unwavering support enabled me to make the project a success.<br><br>

Jordy, your ever-present support throughout this journey has been valuable. Your readiness to help out, even beyond your primary areas of expertise, is highly appreciated.<br><br>

Maosheng, you were there to lift my spirits when I was on the brink of despair, particularly during the Betsy project. Your constructive feedback, coupled with consistent follow-ups, was genuinely motivating.<br><br>

Ian, our conversations have always been enlightening during our one and one, helping me understand things better. I appreciate your patience in understanding my perspective and bridging our communication gap.<br><br>

Stijn, you've quietly made a difference through your fair grading. Though our interactions were limited, they were memorable and led to my progress.<br><br>


I also want to express my gratitude to Steven, a mentor who challenged me in unique ways. While his guidance was tough at times, it pushed me to become more resilient and capable. Thank you, Steven, for your part in shaping my journey.<br><br>

Lastly, Camila, addressing my questions about campus and dashboard issues, and sharing conversations in Spanish added warmth to our digital interactions.<br><br>

In closing, my heartfelt thanks to each one of you for adding unique value to my learning journey. May you continue to inspire students and create more such delightful learning experiences. Because that's what extraordinary teachers do!
